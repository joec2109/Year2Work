XAMPP Control Panel has been used to connect the MySQL database to the software.

The DLLs provided need to be downloaded and placed within the qt 'bin' and 'lib' files.

To set up the project, firstly open up XAMPP control panel, then start Apache and MySQL.

Once set up, create a new database within phpmyadmin named 'oosdproject' (localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser)

Run the project, and the program will connect to the db and create the table required.
