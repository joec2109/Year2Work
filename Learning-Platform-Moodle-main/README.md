# LearningPlatform_Moodle

This was a group project. We created a learning platform for students at a school/college/university.

I focused on the assignments & quizzes pages, and used PHP and mySql to retrieve data from a database in order to show the correct quizzes and assignments to each user. Also, lecturers are able to add assignments to the database as well as quizzes.
